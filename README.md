# Replication Origin
## Coding challenges from UCSD's Bioinformatics I Week 1
Python script that contains tools for analyzing the replication origins of genomes:
- pattern_count: takes a string and a pattern and returns how many times the pattern occurs in the string
- frequency_table: builds a frequency table of how often specific patterns of length k occur in a string
- max_map: returns the largest value of a dictionary 
- frequent_words: returns an array of the most frequent pattern(s) of length k in a string 
- reverse_complement: takes in a DNA sequence and returns its reverse complement
